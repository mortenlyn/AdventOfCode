## What is Advent of Code?

Advent of Code is an annual online event featuring a series of programming puzzles released daily during the month of December. Participants solve these puzzles using their programming skills and compete to earn points.

For more information and to participate, visit [Advent of Code website](https://adventofcode.com/).

## Structure

Each day's challenge is organized into its own folder, and labeled accordingly (e.g., `01`, `02`, etc.). Within each folder, you'll find my solutions to the challenges, written in Python.

## Usage

To run the solutions, simply navigate to the respective day's folder and execute the solution code using your preferred method for running Python code.

## Disclaimer

These solutions are my personal implementations for educational and recreational purposes. They may not always be the most efficient or optimal solutions. Feel free to explore and modify them according to your needs.

I am still not finished with all of the challenges, so I try to solve a couple of days each week when I find the time.
